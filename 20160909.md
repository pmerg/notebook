I put together a script `my-tweets.py` that gets my latest tweets and outputs as markdown. I intend to make this a cron job, and have it append my day's tweets at the end of each days notes.

I was thinking. AI works in a way similar to human brain, which is less "deterministic" and more "probabilistic". So, how are we going to determine if an AI is able to drive a car or fly a plane, or give legal advise? I expect that this will be done in a similar way that humans get certified in such "cases": Diplomas, Certifications, University degrees. Why not? If we are to trust our lives to an AI "driver" it should pass a test, right? In more demanding cases, this "certification" may probably be tightly integrated with the learning proccess. An AI that has a "college" degree, because it went through a "certified" learning proccess, that included many tests and degrees. Of course, an AI may probably be able to complete such a degree in a much shorter period.
