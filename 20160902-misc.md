For some reason, I set up ISC DHCP server on an RPi to handle my dhcp at home, but it feels too complicated for my setup. 
I'll probably change it to dnsmasq, which I'm much more familiar with.

I should also write a blog post about my custom surveilence system and [angelcam](http://www.angelcam.com). Angelcam rocks.

In general, there are a lot of things I should probably blog about, regarding my home setup: VPN, Philips Hue lights, 
network setup, backups...
