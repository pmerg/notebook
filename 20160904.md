Handy: It turns out that if you configure GitHub Pages for an APEX domain, they will also gratefully handle www if you set it up as a CNAME for the APEX.

Example: GitHub Pages setup for `example.io` (A points to 192.30.252.153), and `www.example.io` is a CNAME for example.io. Then GitHub Pages will do a 301 redirect from www to the naked domain.
